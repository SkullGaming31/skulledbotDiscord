<!-- Thanks to djspenser1981 & FameDragn on discord for the idea!
Not that I do much in Discord but I'm in a bunch of servers and one feature I like is one that posts in a #self-promo type channel when Twitch sub or maybe specific Discord role goes live, kind of gives a subscriber/member a nice benefit and not have to go and posts it themselves
