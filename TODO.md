Like a daily useless fact. To increase engagement. A way for anything @me to come into a single convo feed with details about who it came from. And on which server. But it needs to mark as red on both the chat and original server

Not that I do much in Discord but I'm in a bunch of servers and one feature I like is one that posts in a #self-promo type channel when Twitch sub or maybe specific Discord role goes live, kind of gives a subscriber/member a nice benefit and not have to go and posts it themselves
